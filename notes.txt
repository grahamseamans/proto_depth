make sure that slots can scale to be massive (i think that they can and are)

make sure that multiple slots are rendered into the env for the guess, it sure looks like I just have one oblong sphere

check on the input to the nn, and the ground truth.
- we probably want to log-scale distances
- we probably want to clip to nan far away values in the label, so they're not sampled for loss
