SYNTHIA-RAND (CVPR16)
http://synthia-dataset.net/download/810/

Description:
This is the set containing the original 13,407 images used to perform training and domain adaptation of the models presented in our CVPRâ€™16 paper. These images are generated as random perturbation of the world and therefore do not have temporal consistency (this is not a video stream). These images have annotations for 11 basic classes and do not have annotations for instances. The classes are: void, sky, building, road, sidewalk, fence, vegetation, pole, car, sign, pedestrian, cyclist.


SYNTHIA-RAND-CITYSCAPES (CVPR16)
http://synthia-dataset.net/download/808/


Description:
It is a new set containing 9,000 random images with labels compatible with the CITYSCAPES test set. In addition to the CITYSCAPES test classes, we also provide other interesting ones such as lanemarking. The list of classes is: void, sky, building, road, sidewalk, fence, vegetation, pole, car, traffic sign, pedestrian, bicycle, motorcycle, parking-slot, road-work, traffic light, terrain, rider, truck, bus, train, wall, lanemarking. These images are generated as random perturbation of the virtual world, therefore no temporal consistency is provided (this is not a video stream). This set contains groundtruth for instances!
