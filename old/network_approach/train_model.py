"""
Training script for the Proto-Depth model.
Performance-optimized version with vectorized operations and improved Chamfer distance.

This file serves as the central configuration point for all training parameters.

PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS:
--------------------------
1. Vectorized mesh transformation - eliminating loops in favor of batch operations
   * All slots processed simultaneously using tensor reshaping and broadcasting
   * Rotation matrices computed in batches rather than per-prototype
   * Expected speedup: 5-10x for the mesh transform step

2. Efficient Chamfer distance using KNN
   * Using K-nearest neighbors (K=3) approach instead of all-pairs comparison
   * Reduces complexity from O(nÂ²) to O(n log n)
   * Vectorized slot-to-target distance calculations
   * Expected speedup: 2-5x for the Chamfer loss computation

3. Improved parallelization
   * Increased worker threads for data loading
   * Better CPU utilization during training

To run the optimized training:
   python train_model.py
